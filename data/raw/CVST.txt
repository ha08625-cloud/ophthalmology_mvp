Consultation 1
Agent: Hello, I’m your ophthalmology assistant. I’m here to help gather information to help your ophthalmology consultant prepare for your appointment. This may help them to decide if you need any investigations before your first appointment. I’m afraid I can’t give you medical advice or make diagnoses — that’s for your consultant to do. But if you’d like, you can also tell me any specific questions or concerns you’d like the consultant to address, and I’ll pass them along so they can answer them during the appointment. Let’s get started. To begin with, could you tell me what’s brought you to the clinic?
Patient: I came in because of a persistent headache and, more recently, constant double vision.
{ "presenting_complaint_description": { "value": "Persistent headache and constant double vision.", "required": true } }
Agent: Has this ever happened before?
Patient: No, I’ve had headaches before, but never one like this that doesn’t go away, and I’ve never had double vision.
{ "previous_instances": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: I see. You mentioned constant double vision. Do you feel that you have any actual loss of vision, such as blurriness, black spots, or blind spots?
Patient: No, my vision itself isn't blurry, but having two images is very confusing.
{ "visual_loss_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Are you experiencing any visual hallucinations?
Patient: No, nothing like that.
{ "hallucinations_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Are you experiencing any problems with your colour vision?
Patient: No.
{ "cp_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Are you experiencing shimmering arcs, zig zags, or flashing lights?
Patient: No.
{ "vp_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Do you have double vision (diplopia)?
Patient: Yes, that is one of my main problems, as I mentioned. It’s been constant for about a week now.
{ "dp_present": { "value": true, "required": true } }
Agent: When did the double vision start?
Patient: Roughly one week ago.
{ "dp_onset": { "value": "one week ago", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Does the double vision go away if you close one eye, or is it still there?
Patient: If I close either eye, the double image disappears, which I find quite relieving.
{ "dp_laterality": { "value": "binocular", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Is it worse in any gaze direction?
Patient: It is noticeable when I look straight ahead, but I think it gets worse when I try to look side to side.
{ "dp_gaze_dependence": { "value": "worse on lateral gaze; constant when looking straight ahead", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Do you feel dizzy or have vertigo?
Patient: No, I don't feel dizzy.
{ "vertigo_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Any sensation of images or your eyes moving rapidly?
Patient: No.
{ "nystagmus_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Are you experiencing a headache?
Patient: Yes, it’s persistent.

Agent: Is it episodic, coming and going, or persistent and constant?
Patient: It is persistent and constant, unfortunately.
{ "h_temporal_pattern": { "value": "permanent", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Does it worsen with straining, like lifting heavy objects or pushing on the toilet?
Patient: Yes, definitely. If I cough or strain during activities like heavy lifting, the pain gets much worse.
{ "h_worse_on_straining": { "value": true, "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Is it worse at any time of day, like morning or evening?
Patient: No, it seems constant throughout the day.
{ "h_time_of_day": { "value": "none", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Do you have eye pain?
Patient: No.
{ "ep_present": { "value": false, "required": true } }

Patient: No, I waited until I could schedule this appointment.
{ "hc_contact_occurred": { "value": false, "required": true } }
Agent: Any other associated symptoms that you haven't mentioned?
Patient: I recently started taking an oral contraceptive pill, which I suppose is a new thing. Also, the headache is definitely not relieved by resting or sleeping.
{ "other_symptoms": { "value": "Recently started an Oral Contraceptive Pill (OCP). Headache not relieved by rest/sleep.", "required": false } }
Agent: How has this episode affected you?
Patient: The headache and the double vision make it hard to focus on work and daily tasks.
{ "functional_impact": { "value": "Difficulty focusing on work and daily tasks due to headache and double vision.", "required": true } }

Patient: I’m very concerned about the brief periods where I lose my vision, especially now that I'm taking care of my newborn.
{ "visual_loss_present": { "value": true } }
Agent:
Patient: It’s primarily a severe headache and these scary episodes where my vision blacks out for a second or two.
{ "presenting_complaint_description": { "value": "Severe headache and brief visual blackouts.", "required": true } }
Agent: Has this ever happened before?
Patient: No, never. The headache started right after the baby was born.

Patient: They come and go repeatedly.
{ "vl_temporal_pattern": { "value": "intermittent", "required": "conditional" } }

{ "h_temporal_pattern": { "value": "permanent", "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Does it worsen with straining, like lifting heavy objects or pushing on the toilet?
Patient: Yes, and that is exactly what triggers the blackouts—bending over to tend to the baby or straining.
{ "h_worse_on_straining": { "value": true, "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: Is it worse at any time of day, like morning or evening?
Patient: No, it seems constant, though straining certainly makes it worse.

{ "other_symptoms": { "value": "Constant pulsatile tinnitus (whooshing sound synchronous with heartbeat).", "required": false } }
Agent: How has this episode affected you?
Patient: The headache makes it incredibly hard to enjoy this time with my baby, and I’m afraid to bend over because of the blackouts.
{ "functional_impact": { "value": "Headache makes it hard to enjoy time with baby; fear of bending over due to visual obscurations.", "required": true } }

Consultation 5
Agent: Hello, I’m your ophthalmology assistant. I’m here to help gather information to help your ophthalmology consultant prepare for your appointment. This may help them to decide if you need any investigations before your first appointment. I’m afraid I can’t give you medical advice or make diagnoses — that’s for your consultant to do. But if you’d like, you can also tell me any specific questions or concerns you’d like the consultant to address, and I’ll pass them along so they can answer them during the appointment. Let’s get started. To begin with, could you tell me what’s brought you to the clinic?
Patient: It's mainly a general visual blurriness that hasn’t gone away for a month now, and I’ve had a constant, low-grade headache at the same time.
{ "presenting_complaint_description": { "value": "General visual blurriness that hasn’t gone away for a month, coupled with a constant, low-grade headache.", } }, { "visual_loss_present": { "value": true } }
Agent: Has this ever happened before?
Patient: No, this visual blurriness is completely new to me.
{ "previous_instances": { "value": false, } }
Agent: Can I ask if the vision is affected in both eyes or just one?
Patient: It seems to be general blurriness affecting everything I look at, so I think it’s both eyes.
{ "vl_laterality": { "value": "binocular", } }
Agent: Were both eyes affected at the same time, or did one start first?
Patient: They seemed to get blurry around the same time.
{ "vl_onset_simultaneity": { "value": "simultaneous", } }
Agent: And can you describe which part of the field of vision is affected?
Patient: It’s the entire field, generally blurry and disturbed.
{ "vl_field": { "value": "entire field, generally blurry", } }
Agent: At its worst, in the affected area, how much could you see?
Patient: It’s never been a complete loss; it’s just reduced and hazy.
{ "vl_degree": { "value": "partial", } }
Agent: Could you describe what you could or couldn't see? For example, could you read fine print, count fingers, see hand movements?
Patient: I can see hand movements and large shapes fine, but I definitely cannot read fine print or focus on things properly.
{ "vl_acuity_description": { "value": "Cannot read fine print or focus, but can see hand movements and large shapes.", } }
Agent: When did this start?
Patient: About one month ago.
{ "vl_onset": { "value": "one month ago", } }
Agent: How quickly did it develop?
Patient: It came on gradually over a few days, so I would say it was slow to develop.

{ "vl_improved": { "value": false, } }
Agent: Is anything specific missing from your vision, or are you having difficulty recognising things, for example, certain things, people, or faces?
Patient: Yes, actually. A couple of weeks ago, I had a brief episode where I suddenly couldn't speak clearly and couldn't name objects for a few minutes. That was very concerning.
{ "agnosia_present": { "value": true, } }
Agent: I’m sorry to hear that was concerning for you. Can you describe it to me in more detail?
Patient: It was like my speech got confused—I couldn't articulate words and I had transient difficulty speaking, which immediately followed a rapid, unusual movement in my left arm.
{ "agnosia_description": { "value": "Transient difficulty speaking (aphasia) and inability to name objects, following a rapid movement in the left arm.", } }

{ "hc_investigations_and_treatments": { "value": "Over-the-counter pain relievers (unsuccessful)", } }
Agent: Any other associated symptoms that you haven't mentioned?
Patient: Just that I have chronic inflammatory bowel disease, which I know is a risk factor for clotting.
{ "other_symptoms": { "value": "History of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).", } }

Patient: No, none of those specific medications.
{ "toxic_medications": { "value": "None listed.", } }
Agent: Are you having difficulty reading words?  Patient: Yes, the blurriness and the struggle to concentrate make reading very hard. { "difficulty_reading": { "value": true, "required": "conditional" } }
Agent: If you spell out a word letter by letter, can you then recognise it?  Patient: I think the problem is less about spelling and more about the blurriness itself.

But if you’d like, you can also tell me any specific questions or concerns you’d like the consultant to address, and I’ll pass them along so they can answer them during the appointment. Let’s get started. To begin with, could you tell me what’s brought you to the clinic?
Patient: I woke up ten days ago with a continuous, severe headache, and since then, I’ve had some strange flashing visuals, intermittent weakness, and trouble speaking and thinking clearly.
{ "presenting_complaint_description": { "value": "Continuous, severe headache (10 days), strange flashing visuals, intermittent weakness, and trouble speaking clearly.", } }

{ "visual_loss_present": { "value": true, } }
Agent: Could you tell me a bit more about the visual loss?
Patient: It’s not just blurriness; it’s more that my mind feels slow, and I can't put together what I’m looking at or recognize things or names consistently.
{ "vl_description": { "value": "Cognitive slowing and difficulty processing visual information/naming objects (agnosia/aphasia).", } }
Agent: Can I ask if the vision is affected in both eyes or just one?

{ "vl_degree": { "value": "partial", } }
Agent: Could you describe what you could or couldn't see? For example, could you read fine print, count fingers, see hand movements?
Patient: I can see fine print, but I struggle to articulate what I am seeing; I have slurred speech and trouble naming objects.
{ "vl_acuity_description": { "value": "Acuity preserved, but difficulty articulating words/naming objects.", } }
Agent: When did this start?
Patient: The cognitive symptoms developed four to six days after the headache started, which was ten days ago.

Patient: Yes, the confusion and speech trouble have worsened since they began.
{ "vl_worsening": { "value": true, } }
Agent: Was it still worsening after 2 weeks?
Patient: Yes, they are still bothering me now.
