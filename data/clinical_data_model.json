    "arrays": "past_medical_history, medications, family_history, and allergies start as empty arrays. Items are appended as they are collected.",

    "systems_review_status": "Only general_health is fully defined. Other systems (neurological, ENT, etc.) are placeholders to be populated when those sections are implemented."
