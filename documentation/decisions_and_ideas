  1. How to deal with patient questions
  2. How to deal with irrelevant, empty or garbage responses

chief complaint in discovery mode as an episode label

Patient descriptor for each symptom category - can reuse patient natural language

What is an "episode"
- In our system an episode is patient defined: it is a subjective phenomenological segment
- Rationale:
- Let's say for example that someone is experiencing migraines and then has an episode of optic neuritis
- Those migraines might have occurred from a month ago til now (let's say the patient had 6 migraines during that time)
- The optic neuritis might have started 2 weeks ago, right in the middle of the block of migraines
- Those are distinct issues but temporally not separated at all, in fact they are on top of each other
- They might also have other overlapping symptoms
- We don't expect the user to clinically separate them - they dont have the expertise
- We also dont expect the system to clinically separate them - it also doesnt have the expertise
- The solution is that we classify it by the user's experience: their phenomenological classification of the symptoms
- They experience the migraine headache and the optic neuritis as different and so we treat them as separate episodes or issues or problems
- The patient will naturally gravitate towards describing those things as separate episodes, so we may as well roll with it rather than forcing them to conform to a different definition of episodes
- It's not a temporal separation, it's not a clinical separation, it's a subjective phenomenological separation
